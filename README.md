# Implemented Papers

Welcome to the **Implemented Papers** repository! This is where I re-create research papers in deep learning and other numerical fields. I'm doing this to improve my understanding of the latest techniques and to build a handy collection of reusable tools and code.

## Overview

**Implemented Papers** is designed to translate innovative research papers into functional code. By re-implementing these papers, I aim to:

- Enhance my understanding of advanced deep learning techniques.
- Create modular, reusable code that serves as both a learning tool and a practical resource.
- Build a personal framework with classes and utilities that reflect modern research.

## Features

- **Re-Implementations**: Code for various deep learning papers and numerical methods.
- **Modular Framework**: A growing collection of classes and functions that can be used across different projects.
- **Examples**: Example scripts demonstrating the use of implemented methods.

## Implemented Papers

Here is a list of the papers I've implemented, with links to their respective directories:

1. **[NICE: NON-LINEAR INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS
ESTIMATION](nice)**, *Laurent Dinh, David Krueger, Yoshua Bengio* ; [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.8516) 
> NICE proposes a framework for learning complex high-dimensional densities using invertible transformations. It maps data to a latent space with independent variables, ensuring easy computation of the Jacobian and its inverse. This approach, based on deep neural networks, allows efficient generative modeling with strong results on image datasets.

> I re-implemented the NICE model and reproduced the experiments on the MNIST dataset. Additionally, I conducted a personal experiment using a simple sinusoidal 2D distribution as a proof of concept, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in a custom scenario.

... To be continued :-D
