I forgot that the residual are evaluated at  collocation and the target at the N_u points

From an engiennering point of view - and a bayesian one ;-) , I have a really big interest in how to encode prior in method and especially in deep learning that is by essence data-driven and not really knowledge driven. PINN are a really cleaver way of doing that given a known mathematical description.
